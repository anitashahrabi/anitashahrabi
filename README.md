### ✦ About Me

I’m a 15-year-old student from Iran, walking the path of logic and wonder.

I’m deeply curious about:
- 🔭 Quantum physics & aerospace engineering
- 💻 Coding (Python, SQL, and databases for now)
- 🧠 Critical thinking, philosophy, and self-discovery
- 🧩 Systems, patterns, and how things work — from atoms to rockets

Right now, I’m preparing for the Konkur — but I’m building more than just academic knowledge.  
I’m building the discipline, depth, and daring it takes to touch the sky.
